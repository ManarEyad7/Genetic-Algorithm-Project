# Genetic-Algorithm-Project
The genetic algorithm is a search-based optimization technique. It is frequently used to find the optimal or nearest optimal solution
The algorithm is designed to replicate the natural selection process to carry generation, i.e. survival of the fittest of beings. 
### Standard genetic algorithms are divided into five phases which are:
  1.Creating initial population.
  2.Calculating fitness.
  3.Selecting the best genes.
  4.Crossing over.
  5.Mutating to introduce variations.
  
  --------------------------------------------------
These algorithms can be implemented to find a solution to optimization problems of various types. 
One such problem is the following Problem. The problem says that a  bakery wastes a quantity of flour, sugar, butter, and eggs every month, and The factory manager thought of utilizing the wasted quantities to produce other products to increase the factory's profits. He is thinking to add two additional products: biscuits and cupcakes

and we need to find how many boxes does the factory need to produce biscuits and cupcakes to achieve the highest profits?

### Algorithm: 
 

      1. Initialize the population randomly.
      2. Determine the fitness of the chromosome.
      3. Until done repeat:
          1. Select parents.
          2. Perform crossover and mutation.
          3. Calculate the fitness of the new population.
          4. Append it to the gene pool.
